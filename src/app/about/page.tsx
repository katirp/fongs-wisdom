                        Welcome to Fong{`'`}s Wisdom, a collection of chengyu bestowed upon me by the great Master Shi Fu Fong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thank you for giving me wisdom and strength. You are my rock! When I am down or I don{`'`}t know what to do, thinking about what you would do gives me clarity.
                        Even my friends know about Shi Fu Fong because I always tell them how awesome you are. I must have done a really good deed in my past life to be born to you. ü•∞
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I wanted to make this website to save all the chengyu and voice memos you send to me so that it{`'`}s easier to come back to and hopefully to learn them by heart eventually.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love you so much, and I{`'`}m so grateful everyday that I have the best parents in the world!! I miss you so much and can{`'`}t wait to play the pigu game with you again soon.
